This is my solution to the Blog Card Preview Challenge on Frontent Mentor.
I used vanilla HTML & CSS to complete it.
I tried to make this semantically correct, it's not perfect but it's better than the previous challenge.

Here are some things I did and I found interesting or helpful during this.

- asked AI for a code review
- Heard of a naming convention calls Block Element Modifier (for css classes), did not use it but maybe in the next project.

Good day
Dany
